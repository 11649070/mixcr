Fixed absent space in `AA. Seq. ...` column name (affects `exportClones` and `exportAlignments` with `-v` option; fixes compatibility with VDJTools v1.1.3 and below).
minor: Multiple reads in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `filterAlignments` should be now specified as `-i 123 -i 456` or `-i 123,456` etc.
minor: `--reads-ids` in `exportAlignmentsPretty` and `--readsIds` in `filterAlignments` both renamed to `--read-ids`
