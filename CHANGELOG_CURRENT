Clone assembler now separates clones with different V/J/C genes but same clonal sequence (e.g. CDR3)
Added support for P-segments; new gene features `VPSegment`, `DLeftPSegment`, `DRightPSegment`, `JPSegment` now available both in `exportAlignments` and `exportClones`; feature enabled by default
Added new anchor points to encode information about P-segment positions
Action `exportReads` renamed to `exportReadsForClones`
Added option -e/--cdr3-equals to exportAlignmentsPretty action
Added option -v/--write-all to align action
Added new action `alignmentsDiff`: run as `mixcr alignmentsDiff file1.vdjca file2.vdjca report.txt` to find difference between to .vdjca files
Fixed empty alignments in export clones when analysis performed with IMGT reference
Added the following export fields: -vFamily, -vFamilies (same for D/J/C)
Added new options in `align`: `--not-aligned-R1` and `--not-aligned-R2` for exporting not aligned reads at alignment step
Quality aggregation algorithm in assembler changed
Added clone filtration step: filter clones with low quality clonal sequence
Alignment seed is now fixed in order to have completely equal results from run to run on the same dataset
minor: Human-readable error messages for illegal analysis options with IMGT reference
minor: Added new export field: -vBestIdentityPercent and -vIdentityPercents (-j..., -c... in the same way)
minor: Now IMGT import script produces more useful information
minor: Added human-readable error message for unknown species
minor: Better layout of anchor point marks in `exportAlignmentsPretty`
minor: Optional output of read description lines (if present in vdjca file) in `exportAlignmentsPretty`
