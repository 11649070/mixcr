Assembler of partial reads allows to assemble CDR3s from several short reads: final puzzle piece for high quality repertoire data extraction from RNA-Seq data
Added support for P-segments; new gene features `VPSegment`, `DLeftPSegment`, `DRightPSegment`, `JPSegment` now available both in `exportAlignments` and `exportClones`; feature is enabled by default
Added new anchor points to encode information about P-segment positions
Clone assembler now can separates clones with different V/J/C genes but same clonal sequence (e.g. CDR3); this behaviour is turned off by default (see `-OseparateByV/J/C` in `assemble` action parameters to turn it on)
Quality aggregation algorithm in assembler changed (see description of assemble procedure)
Added clone filtration step: filter clones with low quality clonal sequence (see -OminimalQuality parameter)
Added new action `alignmentsDiff`: run as `mixcr alignmentsDiff file1.vdjca file2.vdjca report.txt` to find difference between two .vdjca files
Following export fields added: `-vFamily`, `-vFamilies` (same for D/J/C)
Added new options in `align`: `--not-aligned-R1` and `--not-aligned-R2` for exporting not aligned reads at alignment step (useful for troubleshooting of raw data glitches / analysis parameters)
Alignment seed is now fixed in order to have completely equal results from run to run on the same dataset
Added option `-e`/`--cdr3-equals` to `exportAlignmentsPretty` action
Added option `-v`/`--write-all` to align action
Action `exportReads` renamed to `exportReadsForClones`
Added `exportReads` action to re-export raw reads from `*.vdjca` file; useful to filter TCR/IG containing reads
Added new `-l`/`--filter-locus` option in `exportClones` action to limit the list of exported clones by specified locus
Added new `-q`/`--minimal-clone-fraction` and `-c`/`--minimal-clone-count` options in `exportClones` action to filter the list of exported clones by their fraction of reads number
minor: Human-readable error messages for illegal analysis options with IMGT reference
minor: Added new export field: `-vBestIdentityPercent` and `-vIdentityPercents` (-j..., -c... in the same way)
minor: Now IMGT import script produces more useful information
minor: Added human-readable error message for unknown species
minor: Better layout of anchor point marks in `exportAlignmentsPretty`
minor: Optional output of read description lines (if present in vdjca file) in `exportAlignmentsPretty`
