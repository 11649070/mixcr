New feature (#8 and #36) that allows to extract actual reads that were used in each clone (for more details see documentation)
Import of custom gene segment sequences (`mixcr importSegments ...`)
Automated import of IMGT refenrence segment sequences (`mixcr importFromIMGT ...`)
Beta feature: new aligner with support of big gaps (see "New aligner" section in documentation).
Added new action `exportReads` which export initial reads aggregated by each clones to separate .fastq files
Added new export options for `exportAlignments`: `-cloneId` (prints clone ID that aggregated corresponding alignment) and `-mapping` (same, with additional info on mapping type)
Added new export option for `exportClones`: `-mapping` will pring all alignment IDs that were aggreafated by clone
Added option `-n` (print only first n rows) to all `export` commands
Added new assembler option: minimal clonal sequence length (`-OminimalClonalSequenceLength=...`)
minor: minor improvements and bug fixes
minor: version information embedded into jar file (try `mixcr -v`)
