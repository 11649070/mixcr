Possible set of D genes is limited by loci of V and J genes in current rearrangement
Default output format for `exportAlignmentsPretty` changed for the new one which is more compact and vivid
Two new filtering options in `exportAlignmentsPretty`: `--cdr3-contains` and `--read-contains`
m: Additional micro filtration step for paired-end read aligner (work in very rear cases)
m: Fixed bug leading to incorrect behaviour if `readsLayout=Unknown`
m: Correct progress reporting with `-n` option in align action.
m: Added export options -vHitsWithoutScores (same for J and D genes)
m: Added support for optional compression of .vdjca and .clns files (when specifying additional `.gz` extension: e.g. `mixcr align inut.fastq output.vdjca.gz` etc.)
m: Correct handling of quotes in parameters overriding
