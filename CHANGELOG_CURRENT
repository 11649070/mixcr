Alignments are forced to the corresponding edge if the same V/J gene is detected in the opposite PE read mate
Average quality threshold (`-OaverageQualityThreshold=...`) in `assembleContigs` increased to `20`
Added `exportAlignmentsForClones` action
All indels in homopolimeric stretches are now shifted left in all alignment algorihtms
Smarter base V/J/C hit selection in `assembleContigs`
Read quality trimming (see help for `--trimming-window-size` and `--trimming-quality-threshold` options in `align`) (disabled by default until 3.1)
Fix exception in `-mutationsDetailed` and similar export options
Fixes in step skipping logic in `analyze` (additional automatic parameter adjustment for VDJC libraries covering only `VRegion`)
Several more fixes for `assembleContigs`
