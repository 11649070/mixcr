Correct progress reporting with `-n` option in align action.
Additional micro filtration step for paired-end read aligner (work in very rear cases)
Added export options -vHitsWithoutScores (same for J and D genes)
Added compression for .vdjca and .clns files (when specifying additional ".gz" extension: e.g. "mixcr align inut.fastq output.vdjca.gz" etc.)
Possible set of D genes is limited by loci of V and J genes in current rearrengement
