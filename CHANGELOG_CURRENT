New command ``assembleContigs`` for assembling longest possible contig TCR/IG receptor sequences from several intersecting sequences containing clonal sequence. E.g. assemble all possible sequence information outside CDR3.
New command ``analyze`` for running optimized mixcr pipelines with one single command. Two pipelines which cover most practical cases are implemented ``analyze amplicon`` and ``analyze shotgun``.
New file format ``.clna`` for storing clones with alignments including alignments <> clones mapping
Complete refactoring of command line interface
New option ``--resume`` for resuming aborted / partially completed execution
Implemented ``-nFeatureImputed`` and ``-aaFeatureImputed`` to export gene feature sequences imputing unavailable regions from germline sequences up to the full feature sequecn (marking imputed regions lowercase)
LZ4 based compression `.vdjca`/`.clna` files, 3 ~ 4 fold file size reduction (built into file formats, enabled by default)
Species option ``--species`` is now mandatory #342
Removed ``--chains`` option for `align` action #292
Added export field ``-positionInReference``
Now export fields like `-nMutationsRelative` supports alignment-attached gene features (e.g. this allows to export all mutations of V gene inside CDR3 sub-regions: `-nMutationsRelative VCDR3Part VRegionWithP`)
Now `align` action prints library-level warnings and citation notice
Refactored command line interface of `exportReadsForClones`
minor: fixes for #292 #280 #279 #208 #203 #421
minor: `--noMerge` option renamed to `--no-merge` in assemble action
