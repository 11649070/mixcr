Clone assembler now separates clones with different V/J/C genes but same clonal sequence (e.g. CDR3)
Added support for P-segments; new gene features `VPSegment`, `DLeftPSegment`, `DRightPSegment`, `JPSegment` are now available both in `exportAlignments` and `exportClones`; feature enabled by default
Added option -e/--cdr3-equals to exportAlignmentsPretty action
Added option -v/--write-all to align action
Added new action `alignmentsDiff`: run as `mixcr alignmentsDiff file1.vdjca file2.vdjca report.txt` to find difference between to .vdjca files
Fixed empty alignments in export clones
minor: Added new export field: -vBestIdentityPercent and -vIdentityPercents (-j..., -c... in the same way)
minor: now IMGT import script produces more useful information
minor: added human-readable error message for unknown species
