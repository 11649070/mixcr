MiXCR: a universal tool for fast and accurate analysis of T- and B- cell receptor repertoire sequencing data
============================================================================================================

MiXCR is a universal framework that processes big immunome data from
raw sequences to quantitated clonotypes. MiXCR efficiently handles
paired- and single-end reads, considers sequence quality, corrects
PCR errors and identifies germline hypermutations. The software
supports both partial- and full-length profiling and employs all
available RNA or DNA information, including sequences upstream of V
and downstream of J gene segments.
